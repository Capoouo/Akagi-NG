## What is Akagi-NG?

**Akagi-NG** is the next-generation rewrite of the original [Akagi](https://github.com/shinkuan/Akagi) project.

It is an AI-powered assistant designed for Japanese Mahjong (Riichi Mahjong), aimed at providing real-time situation analysis and decision recommendations for online Mahjong games.

Core Philosophy of Akagi-NG:

- **Modern Architecture Practices**: Fully embrace Python 3.12, React 19 and TS 6.0, constructing a stable, smooth and high-performance system foundation with cutting-edge engineering standards.
- **Ultimate Inference Performance**: Deeply integrate with the high-speed `libriichi` Rust engine, providing full-speed inference capabilities for Mortal-series AI models based on Pytorch.
- **Deeply Decoupled Design**: Highly Decouple decision core and interaction system, providing built-in browser mode and MITM proxy mode, flexibly adapting to various usage environments.
- **Riichi Lookahead Feature**: Utilize `Riichi Lookahead` mechanism, completely presenting the model's hidden strategies during the Riichi phase, eliminating AI decision blind spots.

> [!NOTE]
> **Riichi Lookahead** is a core feature in Akagi-NG, designed to solve the question: "When AI suggests Riichi, which tile should I discard?"
>
> <details>
> <summary><b>Click to view detailed logic of Riichi Lookahead</b></summary>
>
> **1. Why is it needed?**
>
> When the AI engine (Mortal Bot) suggests a Riichi operation, the MJAI protocol simply returns an action `{"type": "reach"}`, and does not directly tell us which tile to discard after declaring Riichi (e.g., `6m`). However, for the user, after clicking the "Riichi" button, the next step must be to discard a tile. Without Lookahead, users can only guess or judge for themselves which one to discard, which might lead to incorrect execution of the AI-recommended Riichi strategy (e.g., discarding the wrong tile resulting in Furiten or dealing into another's hand).
>
> **2. How it works**
>
> The core idea of Lookahead is **"Simulating the Future"**. When the AI suggests Riichi, we create a temporary parallel universe, assume the player has declared Riichi, and then ask the AI engine what it would discard in that state. All simulations in this "parallel universe" do not affect the another real "main universe". Once the Lookahead is complete, we merge the obtained Riichi discard recommendation into the main engine's recommendations.
>
> The process is divided into the following steps:
>
> 1. **Trigger Lookahead**: In the current situation, after inference, the AI engine considers "Riichi" to be ranked among the top 3 recommended actions.
> 2. **Start Simulation**: Akagi-NG creates a new, temporary `Lookahead Bot`.
> 3. **History Replay**:
>    - To let the AI engine's internal state reach the current game state, we need to feed it all events (drawing, discarding, melding, etc.) that have occurred since the start of the game once more. When replaying each move of "one's own actions", the Bot would foolishly ask the AI engine: "What should I do now?". This leads to a situation where, when a game progresses to the 15th turn, the Lookahead would need to perform more than 15 AI inferences. For online models, these are 15 HTTP requests, which would instantly trigger a 429 rate-limit ban.
>    - Therefore, we introduced a "Shadow" Lookahead Bot. During the replay phase, we explicitly know it's just "restating history", so when the AI engine asks "What should I do now?", the Lookahead Bot **completely skips AI inference** by setting `can_act=False`. This makes the replay process almost instantaneous with zero network consumption.
> 4. **Branch Convergence**:
>    - Once the state is fully restored to "now", we manually send a "Riichi" event to the AI engine.
>    - At this point, the AI engine's internal state becomes: "Player has just declared Riichi and is waiting for a discard".
> 5. **Final Inference**:
>    - In this new "Declared Riichi" state, we initiate a **real** inference request to the AI engine: "What is the best discard tile now?"
>    - The engine analyzes the situation and returns the specific discard action (e.g., `discard 6m`).
> 6. **Result Display**: The frontend UI receives this `6m` information. On the interface, it will both highlight the Riichi and other discard recommendations (like "Damaten"), and also display the suggested `6m` in a sub-item of the Riichi recommendation. If there is more than 1 Riichi discard candidate, all will be displayed with their respective confidence levels.

#### Q: I'm using proxy software like Clash/v2rayN, how do I configure the MITM proxy?

<details>
<summary><b>Click to view detailed proxy configuration</b></summary>

##### Configuration Scheme A: Browser Web Version (SwitchyOmega Proxy)

This scheme is suitable for **Web version** players, with the simplest configuration and complete isolation.

**Configuration Steps (Taking Clash Verge's Tun mode as an example)**:

1. **Prepare Environment**:
   - Keep Clash Verge's Tun mode **ON**.
   - Ensure Akagi-NG is started and `mitm.enabled` is `true` (port defaults to 6789).

2. **Install SwitchyOmega**:
   - Search **SwitchyOmega** in the browser extension store and install it.

3. **Configure Profile**:
   - Open SwitchyOmega settings interface.
   - Click **New profile** on the left -> Name it `Akagi-Mitm` -> Select type **Proxy Profile**.
   - In the settings of `Akagi-Mitm`, fill in:
     - Protocol: `HTTP`
     - Server: `127.0.0.1`
     - Port: `6789`
   - Click **Apply Changes** on the left to save.

4. **Configure Auto Switch**:
   - Click **Auto switch** on the left.
   - Delete all existing rules (if any).
   - **Add rules**:
     - Domain wildcard: `*.maj-soul.com  ->  Akagi-Mitm`
     - Domain wildcard: `*.majsoul.com  ->  Akagi-Mitm`
     - Domain wildcard: `*.mahjongsoul.com  ->  Akagi-Mitm`
   - **Default rule**:
     - Select **[Direct]**, then click **Apply Changes** to save.

> Because your system has already enabled Tun mode, direct connection traffic will be automatically taken over and proxied by the Tun network card, so there's no need to select [System Proxy] here.
>
> If you haven't enabled Tun mode and only enabled system proxy, please select [System Proxy] here.

5. **Start Game**:
   - Click the SwitchyOmega extension icon in the top right corner of the browser, select **Auto switch**.
   - Visit Mahjong Soul web version, Akagi-NG should be able to obtain game events normally, while you can still access Google/YouTube (via Tun).

##### Configuration Scheme B: Mahjong Soul Client (Clash Rule Proxy, using Windows, Clash Verge rev as an example)

This scheme is suitable for **Steam client** players. Since the client cannot use plugins for proxying like browsers, we need to modify the Clash configuration file to forward game traffic to Akagi-NG.

> When playing with the Steam client, please ensure Clash is in TUN mode, otherwise client traffic cannot be proxied.

1. **Find Configuration Entry**:
   - In the Clash Verge rev client, click "Profiles" on the left, find your configuration file, or create a new configuration.

2. **Add Proxy Node**:
   - Define a node pointing to the local Akagi-NG proxy.

   ```yaml
   proxies:
     - name: Akagi-Mitm
       type: http
       server: 127.0.0.1
       port: 6789
       tls: false
   ```

   - You can also define a proxy group (Proxy-groups) containing the local proxy node and Direct, making it convenient to toggle whether to use the Akagi-NG local proxy.

   ```yaml
   proxy-groups:
     - name: 🀄 Mahjong Soul
       proxies:
         - Akagi-Mitm
         - DIRECT
       type: select
   ```

3. **Add Proxy Rules**:
   - Force Mahjong Soul related domains to point to the node defined above. Please note the rule order, it is recommended to place them near the top.

   ```yaml
   rules:
     - PROCESS-NAME,akagi-ng.exe,DIRECT
     - PROCESS-NAME,雀魂麻將,🀄 Mahjong Soul
     - PROCESS-NAME,Jantama_MahjongSoul.exe,🀄 Mahjong Soul
     - DOMAIN-Keyword,maj-soul,🀄 Mahjong Soul
   ```

4. **Apply Configuration**:
   - Save and refresh the Clash configuration. Now start the Mahjong Soul client, the traffic path is: `Mahjong Soul Client -> Clash (TUN) -> Matches Rules -> Forward to Akagi-NG (6789) -> Your Network/Upstream Proxy`
